Our base price for binding a single book on letter size paper is $38.00. This price includes trimming the text to its final size and gluing the pages (called Perfect Binding). Your bound text will then be backed with a cotton mull, for added support and to strengthen of the spine of your book. In addition, this price includes your choice of a number of standard coloured and textured cloth cover materials, your choice of standard coloured end sheets, your choice of head bands, and imprinting the title and author on the cover and spine of the book using either gold or silver foil.

### We offer a discount for volume work.

As mentioned above, our base price for binding a single copy of a book is $38.00, but for binding two copies, the price is $30.00 per copy. For binding three copies, the price is $24.50 per copy. And for binding four or more copies of the same text the price is $20.00 per copy.

### Extras

Royal Bookbinders is able to sew signatures, but as this is a labour intensive job which is done by hand, we would have to assess your project and price this work on an individual basis. Please contact us and we would be pleased to provide you with a quote.

In addition to our standard supply of book cloths, we also carry some speciality cloths, which are priced in addition to the basic prices. This is also true of our end sheets. We also offer some embellishments to your project, which are meant to make your great book stand out from all the others.
