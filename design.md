## End Sheets

End sheets (also known as fly leaves) are the hinge of the book. Their function is to attach the cover (or boards) to the text and allow the covers to open and close. Our end sheets are a heavy 90 lb paper which are both durable and attractive.

### Speciality End Sheets

We offer marbled end sheets at an additional cost to our basic prices. For an 8.5 x11 book, add $20.00 to the basic price. For a 6 x 9 inch book, add $10.00 to the basic price. These are hand made, and as a nature of the marbling process, there will be some variations and imperfections from sheet to sheet. They add an elegant touch to any book.

## Headbands

Headbands supply a small amount of structural support for the book spine, but their function is primarily decorative. They are placed at the top and bottom of the book's spine. You have a choice of three colours of headbands, which we currently have in stock. Headbands are included in the basic price of your book.

## Embellishments

Embellishments on a book can truly make it distinctive. Embellishments are only limited by the imagination. They can be as simple as quarter binding, (wrapping the spine in one colour of book cloth, and the back and front of the covers in a contrasting or complimentary cover material) or perhaps quarter binding with matching corners, or corner binding and hot foil stamping accent lines.

Another option is to use silver or gold foil to place a frame on the cover and around the title and authorâ€™s name. This is particularly useful if the title is fairly short. The frame itself can be embellished with decorative corners.

A variation on the frame is to place a picture on the cover and to frame the picture.
