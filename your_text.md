Our Basic Prices are based upon delivery of hard copy(s) of the text(s) to Royal Bookbinders. Your text should be printed with the paper in portrait orientation, have a minimum of 3/4 inch margins all around, and should have a title page. Also, you may want to include several blank pages at the end of the text, as in the case of binding a family history. You can also email your project to us as a PDF file, in which case we can quote you a price on doing the printing for you. If you have an unusual project, then please do not hesitate to contact us and we can discuss your specific requirements.
